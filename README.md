# QueryCollector
##Overview

Query Collector is a native iOS app containing two little questionnaires. The app saves all the answers of those questionnaries in a server and allows to query at any moment, all along the app, answer stats filtered by city.

The app works online and offline; but stats will not be really updated until the app is used in online mode.
